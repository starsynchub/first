<th colspan="3"> Among more modern foundations, the National University of Ireland, founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities – institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the Queen's University of Ireland and the creation of the Catholic University of Ireland in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the Royal University of Ireland, which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and Queen's University Belfast.

The state's two new universities, Dublin City University and University of Limerick, were initially National Institute for Higher Education institutions. These institutions offered university level academic degrees and research from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this.

Third level technical education in the state has been carried out in the Institutes of Technology, which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have delegated authority which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) in their own names. In Ireland the term "college" is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. University students often say they attend "college" rather than "university". Until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.

There are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word "college" in their names: these are either older, private schools (such as Belvedere College, Gonzaga College, Castleknock College, and St. Michael's College) or what were formerly a particular kind of secondary school. These secondary schools, formerly known as "technical colleges," were renamed "community colleges," but remain secondary schools.

The country's only ancient university is the University of Dublin. Created during the reign of Elizabeth I, it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of Trinity College Dublin today; although both are usually considered one and the same, the university and college are completely distinct corporate entities with separate and parallel governing structures. A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, a further education institution, or a secondary school.

In most of the world, a college may be a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university. In the United States, a college may offer undergraduate programs – either as an independent institution or as the undergraduate program of a university – or it may be a residential college of a university or a community college, referring to (primarily public) higher education institutions that aim to provide affordable and accessible education, usually limited to two-year associate degrees.[1] The word is generally also used as a synonym for a university in the US.[2] Colleges in countries such as France, Belgium, and Switzerland provide secondary education.</th>


 <th>The word "college" is from the Latin verb lego, legere, legi, lectum, "to collect, gather together, pick", plus the preposition cum, "with",[4] thus meaning "selected together". Thus "colleagues" are literally "persons who have been selected to work together". In ancient Rome a collegium was a "body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild".[5] Thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, for example in chantry chapels; modern survivals include the Royal College of Surgeons in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the College of Arms in London (a body of heralds enforcing heraldic law), an electoral college (to elect representatives)</th>

<th colspan="4"> There are students who ask for a formula for success...

Now the words from Mr. Chetan Chauhan's Heart.... regarding success...

Good morning to everyone present today. I feel humbled that I was allowed to give a speech on success in my institute where I am grown and what I am today because of this institute. I hope everyone learns new things and your definition of success changes, after my point of view of success.

 So what is success? and why is everyone running after it? We live in a period where everyone wants to be successful. They want to accomplish something in their life. It could be to get the dream job or get good grades on the exams. The point which I want to prove is that the definition of success changes from one person to another. The person sitting next to you will have a completely different view of success compared to you so there is no definite definition of success for everyone around the world.

 


Success could be defined as the measure of happiness or fulfillment one person feels after achieving his or her goals.
Success does not have a definite formula or mantra which applies to everyone around the world. The meaning of success changes from one person to another.
Never chase success as it will only lead a person to be unhappy in life. 
Success requires constant hard work and determination which many people are not ready to put in. 
To be successful in life one needs to set a goal and work towards it with determination.
Successful people are very good at managing time so learn the skill of time management if you want to be successful in life.
Always learn from your failures and past experiences. Never allow your past to define you.
Make a definite blueprint for your life and note down the different goals you want to achieve in a different part of your life.
Do not be demotivated when you fail as sometimes failure is the only thing that will help you in determining your life. 
 Success is a direct product of the hard work you put into accomplishing your goal.
At the end of session, its heartwarming atmosphere creates when Mr. Chetan leaves Institute Premises...
