<td colspan ="3">A galaxy of distinguished Principals, Indian and English, guided the fortunes of the institution during its early years and the “Old Colleges” as it came to be fondly referred to by its alumini and the public acquired a pre-eminent position in the affections of the people of Travancore.  IT was considered an honour and privilege to be a student of the college and to be on its staff.  The pick of the intelligentsia of the State was attracted towards it.  Among the great scholars who served the institution and won high credit and great reputation forfeit and for themselves by their single minded devotion to the pursuit of higher learning the name of the late.  A.R. Raja Raja Varma, Grammarian and Poet deserves special mention.  He has left a deep impression on the language and the culture of the land.  He was Professor of Sanskrit and Dravidian Languages from 1910 to 1918 and also acted as Principal from 1915 to 1916.

the two Colleges grew from strength to strength and became the premier institutions of higher education in the State.

The bifurcation of the old college brought about a certain dichotomy of the spirit between the humanities and sciences and both disciplines suffered there from.  “The richness or corporate life springs from the university of its elements”.  This was realized by the authorities and in 1942 the two institutions were amalgamated.  The reunited College was called the University College.

B.A. Courses in politics and Hindi were started in June 1951.  B.Sc. Courses in Geology was started in June 1953.  The M.A Courses in Hindi was started in 1957.  As new courses were started, facilities for advanced research came to be provided both in the humanities ad the sciences.

The College celebrated its Centenary in a grand manner in July 1969 Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, the then President of India, inaugurated the celebrations.

The B.Sc. (Special) course was started in 1966 in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Botany and Zoology.  But these courses were discontinued in 1969 when the Kerala University abolished them.

The Government vide G.O (Ms.) No. 62/93/H. Edn.  dated 14-5-1993, decided to shift the Graduate courses to another campus in a phased manner.  Accordingly, the First year classes of the Eleven B.A, Degree courses were shifted to the new buildings for the Graduate Section at Kariavattom during 1993-94 and those of the B.Sc. Degree during 1994.95.

<td colspan ="3"><h2>History of College</h2>
The B.A. honours courses in English and History were started in 1914.  Provision for the study of Natural Science (Biology) in the Intermediated Course was made in 1922.  The school section of the institution continued to function in the same premises till 1919.  In October of that year the school was shifted to a new building at Vanchiyoor and the whole of the old building was given over to the College.  The strength of the college, that year, was 561.  By 1923 it arose to 837 and there was great pressure for additional accommodation.  Therefore in 1924 the Government decided to separate the Arts and Science Departments, This step, which is known as the bifurcations’ was given effect to at the beginning of the academic year 1924-25.  The new institutions that came into being as result of the bifurcation were called H.H. The Maharaja’s College of Science and H.H. The Maharaja’s College of Arts.  The later was housed in a new three storeyed building about a mile away at Thaikad.  After the birucation, the Sceience College was affiliated for the B.A. pass course in Botany in 1924 for the B.A. Honours course in Mathematics in 1925 and for the B.A. pass course in Zoology in 1931.  In the Arts College in B.A. Honours Course in Malayalam was started in 1935 and the B.A Honours Course in Sanskrit in 1939.

<td> <h1>CAMPUS LIFE </h1>
I laying the foundation stone for a college we are in fact imparting strength and durability to a system of public education of a high order, which cannot fail to exercise a most important influence on the rising generation and on generations yet unborn.

It is gratifying to me to reflect that English education struck early root in Travancore, that under favourable auspices, it has attained satisfactory growth and that already, pressing on the material limits provided for its by my venerated predecessor, it now calls for enlarged accommodation.

Such a call, it is superfluous for me to say, will at all times be responded to by the Sate with the utmost alacrity. To the numerous pupils I see assembled on this auspicious occasion I will only say: Pursue your various studies with the utmost devotion and perseverance,; show yourselves worthily of the anxious care bestowed on you by your country for cultivated intelligence and, even over following into other countries, prove yourselves formidable yet friendly rivals to those whom other colleges send abroad.  By such a course you will win credit for yourselves and honour for your country.”

The College was affiliated for the B.A. Degree course to the University of Madras, first in Philosophy, in 1884.  Mr. Robert Harvey who succeeded Mr. John Ross as Principal was the first Professor of Philosophy.  B.A. courses in Mathematics, Chemistry, History, Physics and Sanskrit and Dravidian Languages followed in quick succession.  </td>
<td colspan ="3"><h3>Higher education:</h3> A sixth form college or college of further education is an educational institution in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Belize, the Caribbean, Malta, Norway, Brunei, and Southern Africa, among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as A-levels, BTEC, HND or its equivalent and the International Baccalaureate Diploma, or school-level qualifications such as GCSEs. In Singapore and India, this is known as a junior college. The municipal government of the city of Paris uses the phrase "sixth form college" as the English name for a lycée.[8]

Secondary education

Scotch College, Melbourne, an independent secondary school in Australia
In some national education systems, secondary schools may be called "colleges" or have "college" as part of their title.

In Australia the term "college" is applied to any private or independent (non-government) primary and, especially, secondary school as distinct from a state school. Melbourne Grammar School, Cranbrook School, Sydney and The King's School, Parramatta are considered colleges.

There has also been a recent trend to rename or create government secondary schools as "colleges". In the state of Victoria, some state high schools are referred to as secondary colleges, although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in Melbourne is still named Melbourne High School. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, "college" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In New South Wales, some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as "secondary colleges". In Queensland some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled state college, but state schools offering only secondary education are called "State High School". In Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, "college" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, "college" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of matriculation college.

In a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called "collegiates" or "collegiate institutes" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word "college" which avoids the usual "post-secondary" connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as Upper Canada College, Vancouver College) choose to use the word "college" in their names nevertheless.[9] Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the separate school system, may also use the word "college" or "collegiate" in their names. A constituent part of a collegiate university, for example King's College, Cambridge, or of a federal university, for example King's College London.
A liberal arts college, an independent institution of higher education focusing on undergraduate education, such as Williams College or Amherst College.
A liberal arts division of a university whose undergraduate program does not otherwise follow a liberal arts model, such as the Yuanpei College at Peking University.
An institute providing specialised training, such as a college of further education, for example Belfast Metropolitan College, a teacher training college, or an art college.
A Catholic higher education institute which includes universities, colleges, and other institutions of higher education privately run by the Catholic Church, typically by religious institutes. Those tied to the Holy See are specifically called pontifical universities.
In the United States, college is sometimes but rarely a synonym for a research university, such as Dartmouth College, one of the eight universities in the Ivy League.
In the United States, the undergraduate college of a university which also confers graduate degrees, such as Yale College, the undergraduate college within Yale University.
