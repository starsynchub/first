<td colspan = "4">  <h1 style= "color:crimson";>RESEARCH COUNCIL</h1> The University of Delhi is one of the premier institutions of higher education in India, known for its rich legacy and academic excellence. To further this legacy, the University has its Research Council with the objective of fostering university-industry interlinkage, incubation, innovation, entrepreneurship development, and intellectual property rights(IPR).

The Research Council acts as a bridge between the university and the industry, fostering collaboration and partnership between academia and business. This collaboration does not only enhance the knowledge and expertise of students, but also provide a platform for research and development in areas of mutual interest. This platform enables academicians and researcher’s  to apply the theories they learn in the classroom to practical, real-world situations, thereby enhancing their capacity, visibility and ensuring that the industry remains at the forefront of technological innovation.

The Council also focusses on incubation and innovation, providing a supportive environment for students, researchers and entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to fruition. It will provide the necessary infrastructure, mentorship, and approvals to funding to help turn innovative ideas into successful businesses. This will not only benefit the university and its students, but also have a positive impact on the local economy, by creating new jobs and businesses.

The University of Delhi recognizes the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation for economic growth and job creation. The council is also involved in fostering entrepreneurship among students and faculty, providing them with the necessary skills, knowledge and resources to become successful inventors and entrepreneurs. This is achieved through training in intellectual property creation and its management, business development, marketing, and financial management, as well as mentorship from successful entrepreneurs and business leaders.

Intellectual property rights (IPR) is an important aspect of the Research council. The council provides guidance and support to students and researchers in the protection and commercialization of their innovative ideas and technologies which are worthy of fetching intellectual property. The council provides information on patent law, trademark law, and copyright law, as well as guidance on the protection of confidential information and trade secrets. The council also works to promote technology transfers, by facilitating the transfer of university-generated technologies to industry and supporting the commercialization of innovative technologies.

The University of Delhi has a long history of research and innovation, and the Research Council plays a critical role in ensuring that this legacy continues. The council is staffed by a team of experts in the field of IPRs, research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and provides a supportive environment for students, researchers, and entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to fruition.

In conclusion, the Research Council of University of Delhi is committed to promoting research, innovation, IPR generation, IPR commercialisation and entrepreneurship. </td>
