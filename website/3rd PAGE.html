<td colspan ="3"><h1>Finance Officer </h1>  Dear Parents, Guardians, and Valley Middle School Community,

It is with great pleasure that I welcome you and your family to another exciting year at Valley Middle School.  I consider myself very fortunate to work with many dedicated, innovative and caring staff members, parents and students.  Each day is filled with new experiences, learning for all, and the ability to make someone’s day better.

Valley Middle School’s curriculum and practices are consistently reviewed to ensure that we are following the most updated best practices, meeting all regulations, and addressing the future needs of our students.   Our staff consistently follows current trends and, in collaboration with administration, creates a plan of action to incorporate those trends into our classrooms.  One of the largest areas of growth is the increased use of technology in our classrooms.  Each student is assigned a Chromebook that they use throughout the school year.  Students work with Google Docs, Google Classroom, Edu-creations, IXL, and many other programs.  Some of our teachers also utilize the Flipped Classroom method as part of their class instruction.

The students at Valley Middle School are offered many opportunities to explore their interests and investigate new ideas.  We offer many clubs, activities, sports and a large variety of musical ventures that our students can participate in.  Many of our students are involved in a variety of extracurricular activities that allow them the opportunity to grow at their own pace in a safe, nurturing environment.  Our list of clubs, activities and other extracurricular offerings are broadened each year in hopes of including something that interests each student.

Each year we celebrate a theme. This year’s theme is “Stronger Together.”  Throughout the year our staff and students will be using this theme to motivate and guide our social interactions, support our efforts to improve the community, and to encourage us to take care of ourselves and each other.  Being kind is a choice, an attitude, and becomes a habit.

I consider myself very fortunate to be a team member of Valley Middle School as well as in the Oakland School District.  Each day I am amazed by the little things the people of our school community do for one another.  It is these daily reminders that make our school district unique and special. 

Please take a moment and visit our school’s website.  As always, please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Enjoy your day,

Ms. Jacqueline Micari-Christiano

<td><h1>Dean of Colleges</h1>Dean is a title employed in academic administrations such as colleges or universities for a person with significant authority over a specific academic unit, over a specific area of concern, or both. In the United States and Canada, deans are usually university professors who serve as the heads of a university's constituent colleges and schools. Deans are common in private preparatory schools, and occasionally found in middle schools and high schools as well.

Origin
Main article: Dean (Christianity)
A "dean" (Latin: decanus) was originally the head of a group of ten soldiers or monks. Eventually an ecclesiastical dean became the head of a group of canons or other religious groups.

When the universities grew out of the cathedral schools and monastic schools, the title of dean was used for officials with various administrative duties.</td>

<td colspan ="3"><h1> Director,Campus Of Open Learning </h1> Our College started with just a very few departments and minimum infrastructure. There were no huge buildings and sophisticated constructions that we witness today. At the time of establishment of this institution, there were only small blocks. Today, with over a hundred departments and various courses, our college shines with exceptional quality! Many students who join for their bachelor's, continue their education till their master degree at this college. Some even opt to complete their doctorate degree as well. 

This proves that the education provided in our college is extremely qualified. Moreover, there are plenty of other streams that our college offers apart from studies. It is my honour to mention as the College Secretary that our College wins the overall trophy for state level sports competition every year! There are plenty of opportunities for students to seek, to strive and to learn in this College. Our College has developed into a place where students are craving to seek admission at. In the entire history of our College, no student is left behind without admission. Yes! You heard it right. No student is left behind! Every person who walks in willingly to study at our college pursues their choice of course, leading a successful life! </td>
