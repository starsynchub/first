Letter to TRIO and GEAR UP programs' project directors about an ED and HHS collaborative for disconnected youth (MS Word, 76k)

Program Office: Federal TRIO Programs

<strong>CFDA Number:</strong>  84.042
<strong>Program Type:</strong> Discretionary/Competitive Grants
<strong>Also Known As:</strong> SSS, TRIO (SSS is one of eight TRIO programs.)


<strong> Program Description</strong>
Through a grant competition, funds are awarded to institutions of higher education to provide opportunities for academic development, assist students with basic college requirements, and to motivate students toward the successful completion of their postsecondary education. Student Support Services (SSS) projects also may provide grant aid to current SSS participants who are receiving Federal Pell Grants (# 84.063). The goal of SSS is to increase the college retention and graduation rates of its participants.


Types of Projects
All SSS projects must provide: academic tutoring, which may include instruction in reading, writing, study skills, mathematics, science, and other subjects; advice and assistance in postsecondary course selection, assist student with information on both the full range of student financial aid programs, benefits and resources for locating public and private scholarships; and assistance in completing financial aid applications. Education or counseling services designed to improve the financial and economic literacy and assist students in applying for admission to graduate and professional programs; and assist students enrolled in two-­year institutions and applying for admission to, and obtaining financial assistance for enrollment in four­-year programs. The SSS projects may also provide individualized counseling for personal, career, and academic information, activities, and instruction designed to acquaint students with career options; exposure to cultural events and academic programs not usually available; mentoring programs, securing temporary housing during breaks for students who are homeless youths and students who are in foster care or are aging out of the foster care system.</td>
<td><h1 style ="color:crimson";>Requirements: </h1> In a clinical study, eligibility criteria are the requirements that must be met for a person to be included in the study. These requirements help make sure that participants in a trial are like each other in terms of specific factors such as age, disease or stage of disease, general health, and previous treatment. When all participants meet the same eligibility criteria, it is more likely for example that results of the study are caused by the therapy being tested and not by other factors or by chance.

Eligibility criteria consist of both inclusion criteria (which are required for a person to participate in the study) and exclusion criteria (which prevent a person from participating).

In California, for example, it is difficult for students who do not have a parent living in California to establish residency before their mid-20s. In addition to living in-state for 366 days immediately before requesting resident status, potential students must provide documentation demonstrating an intent to make California their permanent state of residence such as a driver's license, ownership of property, or steady employment and financial independence.

If you struggle with motivation or knowing how to complete such a lengthy project, the advisors at the writing center can help you to break it down into smaller steps. You might even be able to set up an appointment with them to meet once a week or once every two weeks to check on your progress. </td>
